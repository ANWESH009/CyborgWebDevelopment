			<h2>General Definition</h2>
			<p>An unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) (or uncrewed aerial vehicle,commonly known as a drone) is an aircraft without a human pilot on board. UAVs are a component of an unmanned aircraft system (UAS), which include a UAV, a ground-based controller, and a system of communications between the two.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unmanned_aerial_vehicle">Visit UAV in wikipedia</a></p>

			<h3>Components</h3>
			<p>Crewed and uncrewed aircraft of the same type generally have recognizably similar physical components. The main exceptions are the cockpit and environmental control system or life support systems. Some UAVs carry payloads (such as a camera) that weigh considerably less than an adult human, and as a result, can be considerably smaller. Though they carry heavy payloads, weaponized military UAVs are lighter than their crewed counterparts with comparable armaments.
			Small civilian UAVs have no life-critical systems, and can thus be built out of lighter but less sturdy materials and shapes, and can use less robustly tested electronic control systems. For small UAVs, the quadcopter design has become popular, though this layout is rarely used for crewed aircraft. Miniaturization means that less-powerful propulsion technologies can be used that are not feasible for crewed aircraft, such as small electric motors and batteries.

			Control systems for UAVs are often different than crewed craft. For remote human control, a camera and video link almost always replace the cockpit windows; radio-transmitted digital commands replace physical cockpit controls. Autopilot software is used on both crewed and uncrewed aircraft, with varying feature sets. </p>

				<h4>Body</h4>
				<p>The primary difference for planes is the absence of the cockpit area and its windows. Tailless quadcopters are a common form factor for rotary wing UAVs while tailed mono- and bi-copters are common for crewed platforms.</p>

			</div>

			<div class="sub-components">
				<h4>Power supply and platform</h4>
				<p>Small UAVs mostly use lithium-polymer batteries (Li-Po), while larger vehicles often rely on conventional airplane engines or a hydrogen fuel cell. Scale or size of aircraft is not the defining or limiting characteristic of energy supply for a UAV. The energy density of modern Li-Po batteries is far less than gasoline or hydrogen. The record of travel for a UAV (built from balsa wood and mylar skin) across the North Atlantic Ocean is held by a gasoline model airplane or UAV. Manard Hill in "in 2003 when one of his creations flew 1,882 miles across the Atlantic Ocean on less than a gallon of fuel" holds this record. See:[62] Electric power is used as less work is required for a flight and electric motors are quieter. Also, properly designed, the thrust to weight ratio for an electric or gasoline motor driving a propeller can hover or climb vertically. Botmite airplane is an example of an electric UAV that can climb vertically.
				Battery elimination circuitry (BEC) is used to centralize power distribution and often harbors a microcontroller unit (MCU). Costlier switching BECs diminish heating on the platform.</p>

			<div class="sub-components">
				<h4>Computing</h4>
				<p>UAV computing capability followed the advances of computing technology, beginning with analog controls and evolving into microcontrollers, then system-on-a-chip (SOC) and single-board computers (SBC).
				System hardware for small UAVs is often called the flight controller (FC), flight controller board (FCB) or autopilot.</p>

			</div>

			<div class="sub-components">
				<h4>Sensors</h4>
				<p>Position and movement sensors give information about the aircraft state. Exteroceptive sensors deal with external information like distance measurements, while exproprioceptive ones correlate internal and external states.[64]
				Non-cooperative sensors are able to detect targets autonomously so they are used for separation assurance and collision avoidance.[65]
				Degrees of freedom (DOF) refers to both the amount and quality of sensors on board: 6 DOF implies 3-axis gyroscopes and accelerometers (a typical inertial measurement unit – IMU), 9 DOF refers to an IMU plus a compass, 10 DOF adds a barometer and 11 DOF usually adds a GPS receiver</p>

				<h4>Actuators</h4>
				<p>The primary difference for planes is the absence of the cockpit area and its windows. Tailless quadcopters are a common form factor for rotary wing UAVs while tailed mono- and bi-copters are common for crewed platforms.</p>

				<h4>Communications</h4>
				<p>Most UAVs use a radio for remote control and exchange of video and other data. Early UAVs had only narrowband uplink. Downlinks came later. These bi-directional narrowband radio links carried command and control (C&C) and telemetry data about the status of aircraft systems to the remote operator. For very long range flights, military UAVs also use satellite receivers as part of satellite navigation systems. In cases when video transmission was required, the UAVs will implement a separate analog video radio link.
				In most modern UAV applications, video transmission is required. So instead of having 2 separate links for C&C, telemetry and video traffic, a broadband link is used to carry all types of data on a single radio link. These broadband links can leverage quality of service techniques to optimize the C&C traffic for low latency. Usually, these broadband links carry TCP/IP traffic that can be routed over the Internet.
				The radio signal from the operator side can be issued from either:
				•	Ground control – a human operating a radio transmitter/receiver, a smartphone, a tablet, a computer, or the original meaning of a military ground control station (GCS). Recently control from wearable devices,[75] human movement recognition, human brain waves[76] was also demonstrated.
				•	Remote network system, such as satellite duplex data links for some military powers.[77] Downstream digital video over mobile networks has also entered consumer markets,[78] while direct UAV control uplink over the cellular mesh and LTE have been demonstrated and are in trials.[79]
				•	Another aircraft, serving as a relay or mobile control station – military manned-unmanned teaming (MUM-T).[80]
				•	A protocol MAVLink is increasingly becoming popular to carry command and control data between the ground control and the vehicle
				As mobile networks have increased in performance and reliability over the years, drones have begun to use mobile networks for communication. Mobile networks can be used for drone tracking, remote piloting, over the air updates,[81] and cloud computing.
				Channel 4 subtone 4 of PMR446 (walkie-talkie) is reserved for voice communication among pilots.
				Modern networking standards have explicitly considered drones and therefore include optimizations. The 5G standard has mandated reduced user plane latency to 1ms while using ultra-reliable and low-latency communications</p>

				<h5>Applications of UAVs</h5>
				<p>One way to achieve autonomous control employs multiple control-loop layers, as in hierarchical control systems. As of 2016 the low-layer loops (i.e. for flight control) tick as fast as 32,000 times per second, while higher-level loops may cycle once per second. The principle is to decompose the aircraft's behavior into manageable "chunks", or states, with known transitions. Hierarchical control system types range from simple scripts to finite state machines, behavior trees and hierarchical task planners. The most common control mechanism used in these layers is the PID controller which can be used to achieve hover for a quadcopter by using data from the IMU to calculate precise inputs for the electronic speed controllers and motors.[citation needed]
				Examples of mid-layer algorithms:
				•	Path planning: determining an optimal path for vehicle to follow while meeting mission objectives and constraints, such as obstacles or fuel requirements
				•	Trajectory generation (motion planning): determining control maneuvers to take in order to follow a given path or to go from one location to another[85][86]
				•	Trajectory regulation: constraining a vehicle within some tolerance to a trajectory
				Evolved UAV hierarchical task planners use methods like state tree searches or genetic algorithms.</p>

					<h6>1-AERIAL PHOTOGRAPHY</h6>
					<p>Drones are now being used to capture footage that would otherwise require expensive helicopters and cranes. Fast paced action and sci-fi scenes are filmed by aerial drones, thus making cinematography easier. These autonomous flying devices are also used in real estate and sports photography. Furthermore, journalists are considering the use of drones for collecting footage and information in live broadcasts.</p>

					<h6>2-SHIPPING AND DELIVERY</h6>
					<p>Major companies like Amazon, UPS, and DHL are in favor of drone delivery. Drones could save a lot of manpower and shift unnecessary road traffic to the sky. Besides, they can be used over smaller distances to deliver small packages, food, letters, medicines, beverages and the like.</p>

				</div>


				<div class="A1">
					<h6>3-GEOGRAPHIC MAPPING</h6>
					<p>Available to amateurs and professionals, drones can acquire very high-resolution data and download imagery in difficult to reach locations like coastlines, mountaintops, and islands. They are also used to create 3D maps and contribute to crowd sourced mapping applications.</p>

					<h6>4-DISASTER MANAGEMENT</h6>
					<p>Drones provide quick means, after a natural or man-made disaster, to gather information and navigate debris and rubble to look for injured victims. Its high definition cameras, sensors, and radars give rescue teams access to a higher field of view, saving the need to spend resources on manned helicopters.  Where larger aerial vehicles would prove perilous or inefficient, drones, thanks to their small size, are able to provide a close-up view of areas.</p>

				<div class="A1">
					<h6>5-PRECISION AGRICULTURE</h6>
					<p>Farmers and agriculturists are always looking for cheap and effective methods to regularly monitor their crops. The infrared sensors in drones can be tuned to detect crop health, enabling farmers to react and improve crop conditions locally, with inputs of fertilizer or insecticides. It also improves management and effectuates better yield of the crops. In the next few years, nearly 80% of the agricultural market will comprise of drones.</p>
